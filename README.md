# RAM-Patterns
Checks for patterns in the RAM 

<h1>Planning Stage</h1>
<b>-Learn kernel programming</b>
-Know that even though the RAM is single side or double side all memory address look like one big chip

-Find the protected memory address space

-Find out how the OS assigns the memory addresses in the RAM</b>

Side note: In the PE file for assembly it is not good to mess around with memory management as Windows signs memory automatically.

<h1>Logical Planning </h1>
<b>Build a kernal</b>
<b>Build Patterns to look for</b>
<b>Try to build a known good pattern list</b>
<b>Build a logic flow for the process</b>
